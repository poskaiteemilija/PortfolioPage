            <h1>Let's talk art and technology...</h1>
            <p>Welcome to a page I designed and developed as an online portfolio for myself.</p>
            <p>
            My journey in technology began at the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in 2017, where I studied it at a higher level and wrote my Extended Essay comparing different graphic tools and their effectiveness. Now I’m currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at University of Essex since 2019. My fields of interest include webpage design and development, networking, and security. I’ve also been working with Java for about 5 years now and still counting. My goal is to become a full stack developer equipped with the knowledge of good design and development principles as well as the skills required to work with web technology efficiently.

            My art journey is a little bumpier. I started going to art school in 2012 and finished it by 2016 with a diploma for excellent results. However, it took me almost three years to regain the interest and energy to continue where I left off. I started sketching and bit by bit my ideas and the mediums of work took me to unexpected places. Not only is art a way to meaningfully spend free time, it’s a medium to release creativity and communicate with the outside world. I’ve also dipped my toes into playing music at concerts, together with a band and even producing my own songs.

            I think of this page, portfolio or whatever you want to call it as a merge of my two personalities – a place where you can get to know me and what I do.
            </p>
            <p>I have a <a>dedicated page</a> which has some information about my projects in art and technology and any other pursuits that currently drive me.</p>
            <p>Consider <a>giving me a message</a> if you'd like to talk about comissions or projects</p>
