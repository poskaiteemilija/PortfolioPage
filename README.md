# PortfolioPage
A React webpage designed to serve as my portfolio as well as a platform to advertise my art and other services.
The purpose of this project is to:

* Develop a portfolio and a platform for myself to gain connections and sell my services
* Learn React and DJango as well as their integration
* Have a project with which I can display my website programming skills
* Create a base for future developments of the webpage for other possible ideas - blog, store

## Main parts of the webpage

- About me section / resume (in a downloadable PDF form also) / home page
- Art projects section
- Programming projects section
- Contact page

## Other functional requirements

- Have a contact button, which opens the user's email and the user can compose a message to my address
- Have links to other social medias (linked.in, instagram and etsy)
- The webpage, after all functional requirements are met, should be deployed on a server under a domain name

_a reminder for myself to develop unit tetsts for every module i push into the project_
_look into continuous integration_

## Non-functional requirements

- Mobile first design of webpage
- Load time 1-2 seconds
